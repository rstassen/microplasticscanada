## The Problem: A Hidden Crisis

Microplastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental and public health issues of our time. These tiny plastic particles, resulting from the breakdown of larger plastic products, have contaminated virtually every part of our planet.

* **Ubiquitous Contamination:** Microplastics are found in our air, oceans, fresh water, and soil. They have infiltrated our food chain and are present in everyday products like table salt, honey, and bottled water.
* **Human Health Impacts:** We are inhaling and ingesting these particles daily. A growing body of scientific evidence links microplastic exposure to serious health concerns, including:
    * Hormonal and endocrine system disruption.
    * Inflammation and damage to human cells.
    * Potential links to neurodegenerative diseases like dementia.
    * Suspected correlation with certain types of cancer.
* **An Unrelenting Source:** Global plastic production continues to accelerate, meaning the problem of microplastic pollution is getting worse, not better.

## The Canadian Context: Where We Stand

While some steps have been taken, Canada's current policies are not sufficient to address the scale of the crisis.

#### Federal Action
The Government of Canada has implemented **Single-Use Plastics Prohibition Regulations**, which banned items like plastic checkout bags, cutlery, and straws. This was a positive first step, made possible by listing "plastic manufactured items" as toxic under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA).

However, this ban only addresses an estimated 1-2% of the plastic waste generated in Canada and is currently facing legal challenges from the plastics industry, which threatens to weaken future regulations.

#### Provincial Action (Ontario)
Ontario's focus has primarily been on waste management through its "Strategy for a Waste-Free Ontario" and reforms to the Blue Box program. The goal is to shift the full financial and operational responsibility of recycling to the corporations that produce the packaging (**Extended Producer Responsibility**).

While important, critics argue these measures are too slow to take effect and do not adequately restrict the production of non-essential and harmful plastics at the source.

## Our Goal: A Call for Comprehensive Action

`microplasticscanada.ca` aims to build a public mandate for a more robust, science-based approach to the plastics crisis. We advocate for federal and provincial governments to take the following actions:

1.  **Expand the Ban:** Go beyond the initial six single-use items and prohibit other non-essential, toxic, and hard-to-recycle plastics (e.g., food packaging, films, polystyrene).
2.  **Enforce Strong Corporate Accountability:** Implement ambitious and legally binding Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws that hold corporations financially responsible for the full lifecycle of their products.
3.  **Promote and Fund Reuse & Refill Systems:** Create policy and infrastructure that shifts our economy away from a disposable, "throw-away" model and towards a circular, refillable one.
4.  **Fund Independent Health Research:** Increase public funding for independent, peer-reviewed research into the long-term health impacts of microplastic exposure on Canadians.
