        <h1>Beyond the Straw: A Petition for Real Action</h1>

                It’s in our water, our food, and now, scientists have confirmed it's in our bodies. Microplastics are everywhere, and we are consuming them every single day.
            </p>
            <p>
                While research on the direct health impacts is still developing, the evidence for concern is clear. These plastic fragments act as <strong>carriers for toxic chemical additives</strong>—like phthalates and heavy metals—which are linked to serious health issues, including cancers and hormonal disruption. Furthermore, laboratory studies suggest the particles themselves have the potential to trigger chronic inflammation and cellular damage. Alarmingly, new human studies have now linked the presence of these particles directly to an increased risk of <strong>severe cardiovascular events</strong>, including heart attack and stroke.

            <p>
                Given the scale of our exposure and the effectively permanent nature of this contamination, the <strong>precautionary principle</strong> must apply: we must act now to reduce our exposure to protect the health of current and future generations.
